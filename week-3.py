# statements we know so far??

# assignment statement
i = 3  # Asking to reserve memory of 4 bytes (this is the size of intger)
        # and put the value 3 in it.
f = 3.4 
msg = "Hello" 
message = 'Hola'
condition = True 
# a variable is a memory that has a size, 
# a name, an address, a value, and a type

#Another statement is a function call 
#The usage of a function is called a function call

print("Hello World!") #The function takes an argument 
                    #and print the value of it to the screen
print(3)
print(f)
print(condition)

# Let's explore other functions.

print(i, type(i))
print(f, type(f))
print(msg, type(msg))
print(condition, type(condition))

# a function call has a name, and (), and in between we have arguemtnst.



y = 3+4 #this evalutes to 7, so I evaluate the exp and put it in y

username = input("What is your name?") # This will evalute to a text

print("Welcome",username)

# The casting functions
#implicit casting

x = 3
y = 4
z = x/y # floor division 
num = 14.5
age = int(num) # casting function 
print("Value of z is", z, ". Type of z is", type(z))
print(age)
y = 4
yf = float(y)
print(yf)
text = str(y)
#print(text + 7) error 

text_as_num = int(text)
print(text_as_num + 7)
#Task: write a program that asks the user to input 
# their name, and send a greeting message with the name

# a function does something, 
# but a function can also take input and output
